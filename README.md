Hey! Im Quinn. (or Ivy. either work.) Im a future computer science student that dabbles in everything ranging from malware development / reverse engineering to game design to robotics.

I mostly like working on low-level stuff and am currently working on a kernel on and off.

I have used Go, Rust (favorite), C, Java, and Python.

If you want to contact me, my @ is quackitsquinn on all platforms.
