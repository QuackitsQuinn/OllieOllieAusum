Hey! Im Quinn. I am a high school student that is facinated with programming, so I do it in my free time.

I know Rust, Java, Python, and bits of C. (Currently, I use rust for almost everything.)

Im constantly working on stuff, and it changes a lot! :)

If you want to contact me my @ is quackitsquinn on pretty much every platform!
